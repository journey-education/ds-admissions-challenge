# Concordia Bootcamps Data Science Admissions Challenge
## About the Project

Using Python and a Jupyter Notebook, you’re going to explore a data set of over 40,000 international football matches! Don’t worry if you’ve never used Python before, this is a great project for beginners and we’ll provide you with all the resources you need to be successful 💪🏽

The original project and dataset are from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).

## Getting Started: Creating a Github Account

You'll need a Github account in order to download all the necessary files and to submit your final work.

[Click here](https://github.com/) to create a Github account.

## Downloading + Accessing Necessary Files

Once you've created a Github account, you will need to download this repository to your local drive.
> Click on the green button that says "Code" > Download ZIP

Unzip the folder. You should have the following files downloaded:
1. [Project Submission Notebook](https://github.com/journey-education/ds-admissions-challenge/blob/master/Project%20Submission.ipynb): This is the .ipynb notebook that you need to submit
2. The [results.csv](https://github.com/journey-education/ds-admissions-challenge/blob/master/results.csv) dataset. This is the csv file that you will analyze
   
## Tools
You will need to use Jupyter Notebooks and Python to get started. There are two ways:
1. The fastest way to get started is to use the free online [Google Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). This runs the notebooks on Google’s servers and requires no setup from your end. You only need a Gmail account.
2. If you prefer to install everything on your computer we recommend the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). This will allow you to run Jupyter Notebook from your computer.

## Project Submission

Regardless of the tool you choose to complete your project, you will need to submit your notebook through Github. 
1. Create a new public repository on your account. It's important that the repository is public.
2. Upload your completed Project Submission notebook into this repository.
3. Send the Github link to the .ipynb Project Submission notebook to your contact person at Concordia Bootcamps by the given deadline.

## Submission Requirements
1. Your submission has to be in the form of a .ipynb notebook.
2. Use the provided Project Submission notebook.
3. Make sure that you run all cells with code in your notebook before submitting.
4. Clean up the notebook, and only leave code required to answer the questions.
